My first project. I'm still learning. This game (I hope) will be a stand-off/last-person standing kind of game with up to 3 players. It is a 
weapon system like Borderlands (tons of generated weapons). The ability to disarm, force others to use a different weapon, form an alliance, 
or power up to defeat everyone using a 2 on 1 fight. Use strategy and you'll need a bit of luck to be the last one standing.
